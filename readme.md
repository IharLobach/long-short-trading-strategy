## Long-short trading strategy

In these Jupyter Notebooks, I developed and back-tested several long-short trading/investment strategies using random forest, AdaBoost, LightGBM, and neural network classifiers. The models use the financial and accounting data from earnings releases to predict whether a stock will outperform S&P500 over the period between earnings releases, the data from 2000 to 2019 from the WRDS database is used.
